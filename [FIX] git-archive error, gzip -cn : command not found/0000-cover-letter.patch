Subject: [PATCH 0/2] [FIX] git-archive error, gzip -cn : command not found

git-archive uses `gzip -cn` to compress tar files but for this to work, gzip needs
to be present on the host system, which sometimes is not the case.

In our implementation, we are trying to add minimal code that will mimic gzip
compression, so as to get rid of this gzip dependency.

Closes: git-for-windows/git#1970

Rohit Ashiwal (2):
  archive: replace write_or_die() calls with write_block_or_die()
  archive: avoid spawning `gzip`
