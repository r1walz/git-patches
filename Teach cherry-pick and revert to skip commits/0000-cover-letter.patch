Subject: [GSoC][PATCH v4 0/4] [GSoC][PATCH 0/3] Teach cherry-pick/revert to skip commits

Yet another iteration of my patch. We have changed the series a little bit. We
now have a commit that rename `reset_for_rollback` to `reset_merge`. A lot of
nit-picks were handled in this revision.

Thanks
Rohit
