Subject: [GSoC][PATCH 0/3] Teach cherry-pick/revert to skip commits

git am or rebase advice user to use git am --skip or git rebase --skip
to skip the commit that has become empty or has risen conflicts. OTOH,
cherry-pick advice user to use git reset HEAD which on the userâ€™s part
is annoying and sometimes confusing. This patch series will bring
consistency between advices of these commands with introduction of
`--skip` flag to cherry-pick and revert.

Rohit Ashiwal (3):
  sequencer: add advice for revert
  cherry-pick/revert: add --skip option
  cherry-pick/revert: update hints
