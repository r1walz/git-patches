         sequencer: add advice for revert
     
         In the case of merge conflicts, while performing a revert, we are
    -    currently advised to use `git cherry-pick --<sequencer-options>`
    -    of which --continue is incompatible for continuing the revert.
    +    currently advised to use `git cherry-pick --<sequencer-options>`.
         Introduce a separate advice message for `git revert`. Also change
         the signature of `create_seq_dir` to handle which advice to display
         selectively.
