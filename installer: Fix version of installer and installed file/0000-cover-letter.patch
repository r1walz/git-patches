Subject: [PATCH 0/1] installer: fix version of installer and installed file

As reported by @JJClements, the File version and Product Version of the installer
and installed binary were not the same. They are set by the `intaller/release.sh`
and by using `sdk build (installer | git-and-installer)` commands, which created
this discrepancy.

Closes: git-for-windows/git#1797
